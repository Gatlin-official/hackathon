# üß† AI Stress Detection System

## Overview

The AI Stress Detection System is an advanced feature integrated into the Student Discussion Groups app that uses **Google's Gemini AI** to analyze messages in real-time for stress indicators. When users send messages, the system:

1. **Analyzes** each message for stress levels, emotions, and intentions
2. **Scores** stress on a scale of 1-10 
3. **Generates** personalized remedies and coping strategies
4. **Sends** private wellness notifications when stress levels are concerning (>5)

## üåü Key Features

### Real-Time Message Analysis
- **Gemini AI Integration**: Advanced natural language processing
- **Stress Scoring**: 1-10 scale with contextual understanding
- **Emotion Detection**: Identifies specific emotions (anxiety, overwhelm, etc.)
- **Intention Recognition**: Understands if user needs advice, is venting, or requires urgent help

### Smart Notifications System
- **Private Dashboard Alerts**: Stress notifications appear only in user's personal dashboard
- **Personalized Remedies**: AI-generated coping strategies based on detected stress triggers
- **Urgency Levels**: Normal, Attention, or Urgent categorization
- **Browser Notifications**: For high-priority stress alerts

### Privacy-First Design
- **Individual Privacy**: Stress analysis is private to each user
- **Secure Storage**: Notifications stored locally with optional cloud sync
- **No Stigma**: Stress indicators only visible to message sender

## üöÄ How It Works

### 1. Message Analysis Pipeline
```

- **7-8 (High)**: Significant stress, needs support - Orange indicators
- **9-10 (Severe)**: Crisis level, immediate attention - Red indicators

### 3. Intelligent Context Understanding
The system considers:
- **Academic pressure** (exams, deadlines, assignments)
- **Social issues** (relationships, peer pressure)
- **Personal struggles** (family, health, finances)
- **Time management** and workload
- **Conversation context** from recent messages
